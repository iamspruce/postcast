Enjoy!Blooming flowers, longer days, milder temperatures — with March just around the corner, the world is slowly but surely awakening from its winter slumber, fueling us with fresh energy. And even if spring is far away in your part of the world, you might sense that 2026 has gained full speed by now, making it the perfect moment to turn those plans and ideas you’ve been carrying around into action.To accompany you on all those adventures that March may bring, we have a new collection of desktop wallpapers for you, just as it has been a monthly tradition here at Smashing Magazine for more than 14 years already. Designed by artists and designers from across the globe, each wallpaper comes in a variety of screen resolutions and can be downloaded for free. A huge thank-you to everyone who shared their designs with us — this post wouldn’t be possible without your kind support!If you, too, would like to get featured in one of our upcoming wallpapers editions, please don’t hesitate to submit your design. We can’t wait to see what you’ll come up with! Happy March!You can click on every image to see a larger preview.We respect and carefully consider the ideas and motivation behind each and every artist’s work. This is why we give all artists the full freedom to explore their creativity and express emotions and experience through their works. This is also why the themes of the wallpapers weren’t anyhow influenced by us but rather designed from scratch by the artists themselves.Timid Blossom“With Spring knocking and other seasons fighting to get attention, March greets us with blossoms.” — Designed by Ginger It Solutions from Serbia.previewwith calendar: 320x480, 640x480, 800x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1024x1024, 1152x864, 1280x720, 1280x800, 1280x960, 1280x1020, 1400x1050, 1440x900, 1600x1200, 1680x1050, 1680x1200, 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 1920x1440, 2560x1440without calendar: 320x480, 640x480, 800x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1024x1024, 1152x864, 1280x720, 1280x800, 1280x960, 1280x1020, 1400x1050, 1440x900, 1600x1200, 1680x1050, 1680x1200, 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 1920x1440, 2560x1440Cascade Style SheetDesigned by Ricardo Gimenes from Spain.previewwith calendar: 640x480, 800x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1024x1024, 1152x864, 1280x720, 1280x800, 1280x960, 1280x1024, 1366x768, 1400x1050, 1440x900, 1600x1200, 1680x1050, 1680x1200, 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 1920x1440, 2560x1440, 3840x2160without calendar: 640x480, 800x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1024x1024, 1152x864, 1280x720, 1280x800, 1280x960, 1280x1024, 1366x768, 1400x1050, 1440x900, 1600x1200, 1680x1050, 1680x1200, 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 1920x1440, 2560x1440, 3840x2160I’m Not Okay, But It’s OkayDesigned by Ricardo Gimenes from Spain.previewwith calendar: 640x480, 800x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1024x1024, 1152x864, 1280x720, 1280x800, 1280x960, 1280x1024, 1366x768, 1400x1050, 1440x900, 1600x1200, 1680x1050, 1680x1200, 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 1920x1440, 2560x1440, 3840x2160without calendar: 640x480, 800x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1024x1024, 1152x864, 1280x720, 1280x800, 1280x960, 1280x1024, 1366x768, 1400x1050, 1440x900, 1600x1200, 1680x1050, 1680x1200, 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 1920x1440, 2560x1440, 3840x2160Let’s Spring“After some freezing months, it’s time to enjoy the sun and flowers.
